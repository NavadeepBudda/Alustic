# Alustic
Using Swift to help people relax by listening to personalized music.

# Inspiration
Almost 50% of people in the US alone are stressed and not relaxed. This just shows how many people are in need for a solution that works. After analyzing these statistics I was sure that this was a problem I would want to help solve. Using data I found the best songs for every situation. These situations range from sleeping to working. Using all of these I was able to create an app that helps with this problem massively.

# What it does
The analytics consists of many songs depending on selected situations. I use these to play specialized songs depending on what they are thinking and doing. We have separate pages depending on what you select in the quiz. The quiz consists of many questions that will alter the experience of the app. One example is when you pick an image in the quiz, the app will automatically change the UI to make it fit your feeling. Users can use all of these capabilities to fulfill their main goal of staying calm.

# How I built it
The entire app was made using Xcode and the programming language swift. I used the frameworks and APIs, AVAudioPlayer and UIKit. I implemented many features through the code including my music player which utilized AVAudioPlayer. By using this I was able to make my entire audio player with custom music. To design my app I used AdobeXD.

# Challenges I ran into
I ran into many problems involving me implementing AVAudioPlayer. This took up a lot of my time, but after doing some research I was able to solve the problem and finish off the app.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud that this is my second hackathon and I am already starting to get the hang of the process. I am very impressed with how my app turned out after countless hours of work. I am happy that my app has made an effect on the world, and I will be apart of this.

# What I learned
I learned a lot from this hackathon, so much that I cant event list them all here. Along with becoming much better with using APIs and Frameworks in Swift, I also learned a lot about hackathons in general and became much more comfortable with competing in coding competitions.

# What's next for Alustic
In the future I want to implement many more features into my app, and overall extend it into the marketplace. I think this app is a great idea and has a lot of potential in the future.
